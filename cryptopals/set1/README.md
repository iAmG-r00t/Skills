# Set 1

If this is are the basics, then I am in for a long journey.

- [Challenge 01](./chall01.py), convert hex to base64.
- [Challenge 02](./chall02.py), takes two equal-length buffers and produces their XOR combination.
- [Challenge 03](./chall03.py), single-byte XOR cipher. [incomplete, currently here]
