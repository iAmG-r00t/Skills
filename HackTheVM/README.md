Hello, we are going to hack the virtual memory for running processes. I found a [repository](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Hack-The-Virtual-Memory/) by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) and I was like I have to learn this.

Here I am learning about virtual memory. ðŸ˜… The repository won't contain everything, just the code because I don't want to duplicate already existing content.

Also if you want to learn C please do visit this [repository](https://github.com/iAmG-r00t/alx-low_level_programming/).
