The [main.c](./main.c) file contains the C code for this first objective, please visit the resources section; *Holberton part 1* to follow along.
- Compile the code this way: `gcc -o loop main.c`

I decided to port the python code to C; [read_write_heap.c](./read_write_heap.c) for general learning purposes. It wasn't an easy task but I managed after a very long time.
- Compile the code this way: `gcc -o read_write_heap read_write_heap.c`
